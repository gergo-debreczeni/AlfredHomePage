  "body": "### Installation\r\nTo install Alfredbot you can either visit <https://slack.com/apps/A2ED8G9J8-alfredbot> or use the Add to Slack button.\r\n\r\nOnce Alfredbot has been added to your team you can deploy the cloudformation stack for setting up roles.\r\n\r\nAlfredbot *does NOT and never will* store any information about your users. The only reason it needs read access to user profile and channel/groups/usergroups information is to set up role mappings.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nOnce you have configured the roles you have to add channel/group/usergroup mapping.\r\n\r\n`Usage: `/alfred-admin <command> <options>`\r\n\r\nDetailed command options:\r\n\r\n`/alfred-admin add <type> <name> <role_arn> <priority>`\r\n\r\nExample: `/alfred-admin add channel general arn:aws:iam::<account_number>:role/readonly 2`\r\n\r\n/alfred-admin remove <type> <name>\r\n\r\nExample: `/alfred-admin remove channel general`\r\n\r\n/alfred-admin list\r\n\r\n\r\nThe priority in the add command is needed so that in cases when the user invoking an aws command belongs to multiple channels that have different roles mapped the most open one would be used.\r\n\r\nOnly a slack administrator can use /alfred-admin command to set up mappings.\r\n\r\n Let's assume he adds the following configuration:\r\n\r\n/alfred-admin add usergroup admins arn:aws:iam::<account_number>:role/FullAdmin 1\r\n\r\n/alfred-admin add channel ops arn:aws:iam::<account_number>:role/PowerUser 2\r\n\r\n/alfred-admin add channel general arn:aws:iam::<account_number>:role/ReadOnly 3\r\n\r\nIf Bob belongs to the admins usergroup and is on general channel we want him to have the most open role, hence the one with priority 1 is chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the slack administrator configured the roles use /alfred-sync start to sync the user permissions with alfredbot.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the role mappings have been configured any user can simply invoke /alfred-invoke <aws command>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nFor the technical bits please see the projects README.md\r\n\r\n\r\n### Plans for the future\r\nMulti-account support.\r\n\r\nShell pipes/commands integration.\r\n\r\nAliases for frequently used commands.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile.
